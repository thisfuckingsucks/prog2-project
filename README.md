# ByteFactory
##INSTALLATION
download the zip  
run the __bytefactory.py__ file in the project file

do not change the order of files and make sure everything is present and can see each other

Spacebar to toggle conveyor mode, 1 to toggle generator mode  
left click on grid to place, right click to remove  
arrow keys to choose a placement direction (for objects not currently on the grid)  
generators and machines must output to a conveyor to work  
Machine input = blue, Machine output = red  
Output bytes to right of grid on green to score them  
Click the start button to start round  
Round ends when the top right clock reaches zero  
Current byte progress is the blue number, Round goal is the red number (reach this to win the level)
